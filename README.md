Project Title: TwigaPlan – Group Saving & Planning Web App
Problem Statement:
In Rwanda, many informal community savings groups (such as youth clubs, women’s groups, student associations, or village-based cooperatives) face challenges with organizing their group contributions, tracking progress toward goals, and keeping members updated on tasks and meetings. These groups often rely on manual notebooks, word of mouth, or WhatsApp messages — leading to errors, missed deadlines, and a lack of accountability.

How TwigaPlan Solves the Problem:
TwigaPlan provides a simple web-based platform for group members to collaboratively:

Set a savings goal, track contributions, and monitor overall progress.

Plan and assign group tasks (e.g., organizing events or collecting funds).

Stay informed through a central dashboard showing updates, upcoming meetings, and group activities.

This solution makes group savings more transparent, organized, and efficient — especially for youth-led or low-resource groups with access to mobile phones or cyber cafes.
